# SMB Ops Dashboard ‚Äì Project Tracker

Use this as the living project dashboard. Check items off as you complete them. Add dates, owners, and notes inline.

## üî≠ Vision & One‚Äëliner
**Goal:** Build an SMB operations dashboard (MVP) that ingests sales/inventory/schedule data, visualizes KPIs, and sends actionable alerts.

**One‚Äëliner:** "A lightweight, plug‚Äëand‚Äëplay dashboard with real‚Äëtime alerts that helps small retailers stop stock‚Äëouts and optimize staffing."
